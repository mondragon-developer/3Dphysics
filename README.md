Physics Principles
The simulation demonstrates several fundamental physics concepts:
1. Gravitational Force

Component parallel to incline: F_g∥ = m × g × sin(θ)
Component perpendicular to incline: F_g⊥ = m × g × cos(θ)

2. Friction Force

Sliding friction: F_friction = μ × N
Where N is the normal force and μ is the coefficient of friction

3. Air Resistance (Drag)

Drag force: F_drag = 0.5 × ρ × C_d × A × v²
Where:

ρ = air density (1.225 kg/m³)
C_d = drag coefficient (0.47 for sphere)
A = cross-sectional area
v = velocity

4. Buoyancy Effect

Buoyant force: F_buoy = ρ_air × V × g
Effective gravity: g_eff = g × (1 - ρ_air/ρ_sphere)

5. Energy Conservation

Potential Energy: PE = m × g × h
Kinetic Energy: KE = 0.5 × m × v²
Total Energy: TE = PE + KE (with losses due to friction and drag)
